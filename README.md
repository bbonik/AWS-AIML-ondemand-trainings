## Amazon SageMaker Deep Dive Series
About: Amazon SageMaker is a fully managed service to build, train, and deploy machine learning (ML) models for any use case with fully managed infrastructure, tools, and workflows. In this series, learn how to use Amazon SageMaker to support your end-to-end ML lifecycle, from data labeling to model deployment. Understand the core functionality of the service, how Amazon SageMaker works under the hood, and how to develop your ML models in a cost-effective manner. This series is designed for data engineers, data scientists, and developers with prior experience in machine learning and basic knowledge of AWS services. 

1. [**Data labelling and quick starts**](https://explore.skillbuilder.aws/learn/course/internal/view/elearning/11791/aws-partnercast-amazon-sagemaker-deep-dive-series-data-labeling-and-quick-starts-technical) (i.e. Ground Truth, Canvas, Autopilot, JumpStart). Supervised machine learning algorithms rely on high-quality labelled training data. Learn how to take advantage of Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth, which offers pre-built and custom labelling workflows for any use case, various workforce options, automated labelling, and more. Once a labelled dataset is available, learn how to use Amazon SageMaker Canvas, Autopilot, and JumpStart, built to help data analysts and data scientists quickly train high-quality machine learning models using auto ML and open-source models.

2. **Experimentation and development with notebooks** Amazon SageMaker enables data scientists to develop algorithms in familiar development environments, using powerful frameworks. In this video, learn how to choose between classic Jupyter notebooks, Amazon SageMaker Studio, and RStudio to set up your preferred workspace. For every environment, Amazon SageMaker provides built-in algorithms, managed environments with popular frameworks and libraries, and the option to bring your own environment and algorithm. Understanding each mechanism and how to use it helps data scientists increase their productivity.

3. **Data preprocessing and feature engineering**. Data scientists and data engineers spend a significant amount of time aggregating, analysing, and cleaning data before performing feature engineering. In this session, learn how to use Amazon SageMaker Data Wrangler to build a visual data processing workflow. Alternatively, learn about Amazon SageMaker Processing Jobs to perform data manipulation through code, or learn how Amazon SageMaker integrates with Amazon EMR for processing data on large clusters using Hadoop or Spark. Finally, understand how Amazon SageMaker Clarify can be used to identify bias in datasets as part of your responsible AI workflow.

4. **Model training and tuning** It can be challenging to arrange the infrastructure needed for large-scale model training and hyperparameter tuning. Amazon SageMaker provides scalable, easy-to-use training jobs and hyperparameter tuning jobs to run workloads for large datasets and models. Learn how to use these core Amazon SageMaker components, and understand the additional features available for reducing cost and improving productivity, including Debugger, distributed training, and managed spot training.

5. **Model deployment** Determining the best deployment methods for your model requires balancing requirements for cost, availability, latency, reliability, and more. In this session, learn about the various deployment methods provided by Amazon SageMaker, the benefits of each method, and how to make the right choice using Inference Recommender.
